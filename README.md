# DigiTour

DigiTours is a virtual tour service focused on personalization and human connection.
The service enhances the virtual tour experience by providing the customer with multiple tour options which range in personal touch, 
from basic pre-recorded tours of popular locations, to customized tour videos of the customer's desired locations (accompanied by a live Q&A with a tour guide), 
to 1-on-1 video streaming with a tour guide in which the customer can interact on their terms and tour their desired location the way they want to.
All personalized tours are fully customizable, including the exact location anywhere around the world, a list of guides local to that area for the customer to choose from,
and the date and time the customer desires to take their tour. All video from the tour is then sent to the customer to be kept.
